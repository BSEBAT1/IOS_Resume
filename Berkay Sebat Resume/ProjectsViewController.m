I worked on this idea during my senior year of college entering the finals of the Hofstra University Entrepreneurship competition but loosing the 100,000 grand prize to a software startup. The tablet worked by taking advantage of the MHL 3.0 standard developed by Silicon Image Systems in California. The design called for a low cost image processor attached to a battery and a screen all housed in a plastic case. Once connected to the tablet two way signaling between a touch screen and the phone would effectively mirror the phone into a tablet device. I stopped working on this idea after patent problems with ASUS";

I uploaded the CSV to a MSYQL DB and used XML DOM notation to get the data which I looped through using JS to create a plot and details of the restaurants. I then connected the page to live weather and disasters services using Google KML live feed API.This page is used by risk managers to help asses insurance claims during catastrophic events.";

I also meet with our account executives to help create new reports for the client to use. Currently I am working with the data entry department to create better documentation and procedures for data loading and health care auditing. Learning WEBFOCUS has been quite a challenge as with other older languages support is low and documentation is quite lacking. However this did not stop me from attaining my current position";
